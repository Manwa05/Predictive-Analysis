# Predictive-Analysis

This project was implemented in Python language. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow was also used.

4 Major tasks performed in this project are as follows-

1.Implemented Principal Components Analysis(Dimensionality Reduction), K-Nearest Neighbors and K-means clustering models from scratch using Numpy and Pandas.

2.Using Bagging and Bootstrap aggregration, developed multiple decision tree classifiers and implemented Random Forest classification from scratch.

3.Developed Ensemble Model using K-NN, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models and implemented the voting classifier on them that gave 97% accuracy in classification of data using scikit-learn.

4.Performed GridSearch on SVM, K-NN and Decision Tree models to tune their hyperparameters and output optimal hyperparameters with 95% accuracy.
